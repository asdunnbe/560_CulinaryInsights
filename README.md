## Introduction

Imagine it’s getting towards the end of the week. Dinner time rolls around and you look in the cupboard where a spattering of odd ingredients wait. No matter how hard you stare at the curious shmorgishborg no recipes come to mind. It’s this problem that we aim to fix: given an input of ingredients, provide a recipe while minimizing the number of ingredients you’d have to buy.

We hope to approach the problem in two vastly different ways in order to compare and contrast methodologies. First we will use an A* search algorithm to sort through a database of recipes according to a function of our own devising. Then we will train a language learning model to generate responses for this specific food related task.

As we work, we may add advancements to the search functionality. Accounting for nutritional factors and taking in cuisine preferences are two improvements to the base design that we’ve considered.

There are various similar services available over the internet. Dishgen is an existing application of language learning models for a similar purpose. It takes in prompts flexibly and creates new recipes that aren’t necessarily preexisting. Another notable service is MealPractice, where users select one of multiple preset attributes ranging from protein options to dietary limitations. It then gives three options for users to choose from and generates a recipe.
